BoarG
=====
Description
-----------
Boarg is a simple GUI for the Version control System boar (www.boarvcs.com). It works as a wrapper for boar's command line Interface.
It is intended to be platform independent and has been tested on Linux and Windows 7.

It is not yet feature complete, as it does not support all of boarâ€™s command line options.

Already supported are the following functions:
- creating repositories
- creating sessions
- get the status of a workdir
- update a workdir
- commit changes within a workdir

Prerequisites
-------------

- PySide - www.qt-project.org/wiki/PySide (tested with PySide 1.2.1)
- QT - www.qt-project.org/ (will be installed with PySide)

Run BoarG
